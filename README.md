# TeleMafia Bot (Golang)

This is a Telegram bot for managing chat rooms, built with Golang. It follows SOLID principles and supports both JSON-based and Command-Line configurations.

## 🛠 Installation

### 1️⃣ Install Go
Make sure you have Go installed (at least Go 1.18). You can download it from:
- Official Go Website: https://go.dev/dl/

## 🚀 Running the Bot

### Option 1: Using config.json
1. Create a config.json file in the project root with the following structure:
   ```json
   {
   "telegram_bot_token": "YOUR_TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN",
   "admin_usernames": ["admin1", "admin2"]
   }

2. Run the bot:

```sh
go run main.go
```

### Option 2: Using Command-Line Arguments
If you don't have a config.json, you can pass parameters directly when starting the bot:

```sh
go run main.go -token "YOUR_TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN" -admins "admin1,admin2"
```

- Replace YOUR_TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN with your actual bot token.
- Replace admin1,admin2 with a comma-separated list of admin usernames.

Example:

```sh
go run main.go -token "123456789:ABCDEF-TOKEN" -admins "john_doe,admin_user"
```

## 📝 Bot Commands
The bot supports the following commands:

| Command                   | Description                                 | Who Can Use?  |
|---------------------------|---------------------------------------------|--------------|
| /show_rooms              | Show a list of available rooms.             | Everyone    |
| /join_room <room_name>   | Join a specific room.                       | Everyone    |
| /create_room <room_name> | Create a new room (Admin Only).             | Admins Only |

---

## 🔧 How It Works
1. The bot reads configuration settings from config.json.
2. If config.json is missing or invalid, it will switch to command-line arguments (-token & -admins).
3. The bot then connects to Telegram and starts processing user commands.
4. Admins are identified by their username instead of ID for security reasons.

## 🛠 Troubleshooting
🔹 Problem: "Missing bot token" error  
✔️ Solution: Ensure you provide a token via config.json or CLI (-token argument).

🔹 Problem: "Admins not detected"  
✔️ Solution: Ensure the admin usernames are correctly formatted and match the usernames on Telegram.
