# TeleMafia Bot (Golang)

This is a Telegram bot for managing Mafia game rooms, built with Golang. It features a layered architecture, dependency injection, and uses Command Query Responsibility Segregation (CQRS) principles for handling actions. Configuration is supported via both `config.json` and command-line arguments.

**Important Note:** This bot currently uses **in-memory storage**. This means all rooms, scenarios, games, and user data will be **lost** when the bot restarts.

## üöÄ Running the Bot

### Option 1: Using config.json
1. Create a `config.json` file in the project root with the following structure:
   ```json
   {
     "telegram_bot_token": "YOUR_TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN",
     "admin_usernames": ["admin1", "admin2"]
   }
   ```
   * Replace `YOUR_TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN` with your actual bot token.
   * Replace `admin1`, `admin2` with a comma-separated list of admin usernames (case-sensitive).

2. Run the bot:
   ```sh
   go run main.go
   ```

---

### Option 2: Using Command-Line Arguments
If you don't have a `config.json`, you can pass parameters directly when starting the bot:

```sh
go run main.go -token "YOUR_TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN" -admins "admin1,admin2"
```

* Replace `YOUR_TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN` with your actual bot token.
* Replace `admin1,admin2` with a comma-separated list of admin usernames (case-sensitive).

Example:

```sh
go run main.go -token "123456789:ABCDEF-TOKEN" -admins "john_doe,admin_user"
```

## üîß How It Works

1.  **Configuration:** The bot reads settings (`telegram_bot_token`, `admin_usernames`) from command-line arguments (`-token`, `-admins`) first. If not provided, it falls back to `config.json`.
2.  **Initialization:** It sets up the Telegram bot connection, initializes in-memory repositories for rooms, scenarios, and games, and prepares command/query handlers.
3.  **Architecture:** The bot follows a layered architecture:
    *   **Delivery (Telegram):** Handles incoming Telegram commands and callbacks, interacts with users.
    *   **Internal (Core Logic):** Contains use cases (commands/queries), domain entities (Room, Game, Scenario, User), and repository interfaces. Uses CQRS pattern.
    *   **Infrastructure:** Provides concrete implementations (currently in-memory) for repositories.
4.  **Command Handling:** Incoming commands are routed to specific handlers in the delivery layer, which then execute corresponding use cases in the internal layer.
5.  **Data Storage:** All application data (rooms, players, scenarios, games) is stored **in memory** and is **lost** upon bot restart.
6.  **Admin Identification:** Admins are identified by their Telegram **username** (case-sensitive) as provided in the configuration.

## üõ† Troubleshooting

üîπ **Problem:** "Missing bot token" error
‚úîÔ∏è **Solution:** Ensure you provide a valid Telegram bot token via `config.json` or the `-token` command-line argument.

üîπ **Problem:** "Admins not detected" or admin commands don't work
‚úîÔ∏è **Solution:** Ensure the admin usernames in `config.json` or the `-admins` argument exactly match the Telegram usernames (case-sensitive).

üîπ **Problem:** Rooms, scenarios, or game data disappear after restarting the bot.
‚úîÔ∏è **Solution:** This is expected behavior. The bot currently uses **in-memory storage**, which does not persist data.
