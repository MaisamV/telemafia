## üöÄ Running the Bot

### Option 1: Using config.json
1. Create a config.json file in the project root with the following structure:
   ```json
   {
   "telegram_bot_token": "YOUR_TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN",
   "admin_usernames": ["admin1", "admin2"]
   }

2. Run the bot:

```sh
go run main.go
```

---

### Option 2: Using Command-Line Arguments
If you don't have a config.json, you can pass parameters directly when starting the bot:

```sh
go run main.go -token "YOUR_TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN" -admins "admin1,admin2"
```

- Replace YOUR_TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN with your actual bot token.
- Replace admin1,admin2 with a comma-separated list of admin usernames.

Example:

```sh
go run main.go -token "123456789:ABCDEF-TOKEN" -admins "john_doe,admin_user"
```

## üìù Bot Commands
The bot supports the following commands:

| Command                   | Description                                 | Who Can Use?  |
|---------------------------|---------------------------------------------|--------------|
| /start                   | Start the bot                               | Everyone    |
| /help                    | Show this help message                      | Everyone    |
| /create_room <room_name> | Create a new room                           | Admins Only |
| /join_room <room_id>     | Join a specific room                        | Everyone    |
| /leave_room <room_id>    | Leave a specific room                       | Everyone    |
| /list_rooms              | List all available rooms                    | Everyone    |
| /my_rooms                | List rooms you have joined                  | Everyone    |
| /kick_user               | Kick a user from a room                     | Admins Only |

## üîß How It Works
1. The bot reads configuration settings from config.json.
2. If config.json is missing or invalid, it will switch to command-line arguments (-token & -admins).
3. The bot then connects to Telegram and starts processing user commands.
4. Admins are identified by their username instead of ID for security reasons.

## üõ† Troubleshooting
üîπ Problem: "Missing bot token" error  
‚úîÔ∏è Solution: Ensure you provide a token via config.json or CLI (-token argument).

üîπ Problem: "Admins not detected"  
‚úîÔ∏è Solution: Ensure the admin usernames are correctly formatted and match the usernames on Telegram.
